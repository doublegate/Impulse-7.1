- New user voting creates a Runtime error 2 occured at 5075:310.

  * SOLUTION: Delete NUV.DAT from .\DATA directory.

  Noticed that when you disable NUV and DELETE the user, the error
  still occurs because NUV.DAT wasn't deleted.

- The colours in the system setup are striped into cyan for no reason.

  Also, colours in the user configuration sometimes gets swapped when you
  switch back and forth.

- When you toggle expert mode on then turn it back off it won't display
  the menus even if user uses the "?" command.

- Internal ansi display driver in Impulse sucks I have seen grass move faster
  then it. Also it puts odd trails of color in the back of the lines where
  the ansi should end.

- Screen pauses literaly DESTROYS the ansi when it pauses it, leaving trails
  where the pause prompt was.

  Also screen pauses sometimes pauses at different spots, on LOGON.ANS my
  picture pauses after EVERY line.

- The status bar gets pushed off the screen when string 2 - handle prompt
  gets to the end of the screen.

  Hmmm, seems like it works properly again.

- String 29 - bulletin prompt doesnt work correctly with pipe codes.

- Screen refresh in user configuration is slower then fuck.

  * SOLUTION: Possibly use direct video writes for the lightbars.

- New user application needs to be re-worked, its horribly done.

  User is allowed to have non-standard handles.
  User is allowed to have passwords that consist of a space or 1 character.
  User is allowed to enter 00/00/00 for their birthdate.

- Cute bug, won't let me enter " smoke " for my nickname, I have to use
  " 2 " to login.

  This bug is FUCKING WIERD, I logged in as a new user, and can login with
  the users proper name, will look futher into this bug.

  Ok, I found out how to fix it partically, delete the account then restore
  it. It will work as normal. Still figuring out what the fuck is going on.

  Its not USER.LST because, I have made a new one, and still it doesnt
  recognize the user.

  OK I FINALLY FOUND OUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE!! YAY!!
  Don't know how EXACTLY it happened but, Black Knight and Smoke were removed
  from the NAMES.LST and it doesn't get updated.

- Message base can be on ANY conference even if it doesnt exist.

- Impulse chokes if some system files are missing from the .\DATA directory

- Status bar disappears when you enable it, and excute another command.

- Very odd bug, screen size got smaller for some odd reason, but I fixed it
  by toggling the status bar on/off.

  Found it!! Ok, this is what happens, when I toggle the status bar on/off
  the status bar disappears, like the bug above, but then takes up 2 lines
  so it seems that the screen height got smaller.

- When you delete a user with /xxx4 protection, it will say they are deleted
  in the user configuration, but when you edit them, it wont say they are
  deleted.

- When you try to display and ansi with the menu command -F with the ansi
  filename as LOGON.* it will create a runtime error.

- In the new user application process it doesnt save their phone numbers
  right, it saves it as 000i000|0000 or some other wierd shit.
