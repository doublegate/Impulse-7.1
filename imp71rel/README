I added an install program, so there is no longer a need to run impulse -D,
that is unless you are moving your impulse setup to another directory.

this is a test release, its sloppy, its dirty, and it doesn't work right.

I also need some art done, ansis, asciis or whatever.

I would like people to send me bug reports with as much info as possible.

Don't bug me or i'll be a bitch and not release anymore test versions of
impulse.

I will try and release a new test copy every weekend, but if that doesn't
happen, don't mail me saying, 'where is the new copy of impulse blah blah'.

Send me donations. If you are at all interested, send me e-mail to
foosep01@student.ucr.edu

If someone feels like designing a page, design it, then mail me about it,
don't tell me you will design it before you do, because chances are you won't
design it, and i'll be left with my pants down.

Ok, since alot of people seemed to want this, i have added in a configurable
waiting for callers screen.  To make your own configurable WFC screen, you
will need to follow a few instructions.

1) Get yourself the ansi you want to use, load it up in an editor, and save
it as an 80(columns)x25(rows) BINARY file.
2) Next you need to make a text file which is laid out in the following way:
   XX
   YY
   NN
   HH
   Where XX is the x-coordinate, YY is the y-coordinate, NN is the normal
   attribute, and HH is the highlighted attribute.
3) Next type 'makewfc <binary_file> <text_file>' this will output 'wfc.bin'.
4) Copy 'wfc.bin' to your data directory, and walla, you have a new wfc
   screen.

To make your own configurable new user apply process do the following:
1) edit a textfile, and place upto 22 of the following codes, each on a
   seperate line.
2) save the file, then at the dos prompt, run "makenuo order.txt" (where
   order is the name of the text file you just made).
3) This will ouput a file called "nuorder.dat", move this file into your
   DATA directory.
4) Load impulse and it should work.

Important note, this file comes as is, if it fucks up, oh well, its not my
fault.

More important, impulse was made possible by my main man, brandon sneed
(nivenh), so give him props when you see him.

Most importantly have fun.
