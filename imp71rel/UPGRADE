If you are upgrading from one of the earlier 7.X releases(rc1-3), then all you
really have to do is overwrite your imp.exe and imp.ovr files, as well as
copy the file 'global.mnu' to your menus directory. Allthough this will work,
unless you have actually modded your earlier release, i suggest just
reinstalling.
