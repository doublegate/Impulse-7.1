This is a list of what I plan to do to impulse, in no particular order:
%% Configurable logon process
++ All strings configurable
++ Re-do the configuration program
%% Fix the matrix apply bug
%% Get rid of the multiple help levels in menus(who uses these?)
-- More complete/configurable multi-node support
-- JAM message bases
++ Smaller Exe/Ovr size
++ Speed increases
++ Less memory requirements
%% An install program
